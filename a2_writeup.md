# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
When completing the match function, the most difficult part was the if statement for the % sign. Python would try to access an out of bounds index of the list if I tried to check the next element of the pattern when the % was at the end. 



2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You could use the match function to create prompt templates for theoretical questions the user could ask the movie database, so that information from the prompt could be easily extracted.
